# Whack a mole (on steroids)
This is whack a mole with additional powerups I made for my CS50 final project.

## Play the game
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/tovicheung/whack-a-mole
```

2. Run `main.py`
```
python3 main.py
```

## How to play?
Move the mouse and click!

## Power-Ups
The power-ups are fun (and somewhat silly lol)
- Hourglass: adds 5 seconds
- Fox: summon 5 foxes to eat moles
- Wind: summon a hurricane that follows the cursor (no need to click to kill the moles)

## Screenshots
